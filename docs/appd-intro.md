#  AppD Specification



The FDC3 App Directory provides trusted identity for financial desktop apps. This identity can be used to prevent spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks when apps communicate with one another and exchange data. The App Directory also enables service discovery. Apps are registered with a declaration of the intents and context data that can be used when interoperating.



## Core features

- Provide verification of identity for an application running on a desktop - whether it is Native, Web, or Hybrid.
- Resolve human readable names for applications to the location of and instructions for launching
- Serve as a repository for application metadata supporting discoverability by intent, context, and other workflow driven facets.

- [Application Directory Use](/AppD_Use) provides a simple view on how application directories can be used.  This also includes links to a reference implementation.
- [API specification](/appd-specification) is the interface definition required to support a compatible application directory.
